This is the overview of the functionality of the cursor agent:

@Project_Description/ I now want you to use all of this informtion, and combine it into 1 single md file of basiaclly my whole project. This will be used to add into chatgpt so it can follow along on every major and minor change it makes. I want this to log every detail of what happens. Here is the workflow of how this system works. @Formatted_Project_EDITING/ this is the current app. This is all my working files and updates. Wheneber I make a change in the cursor editor. I want the content here, to then change the wording in an update style to this @Project_Description/ area. This allows me to get a detailed observation of the changes happening to each file. I want the changes to be added to the top of the md files so it's easy to see when I open each file. Once this is upadated, the changes are then added into the @all_edits.md inside this folder@Overall_Project_description/ . This will be a long worded document so chatgpt can understand what the whole entire code is. I want all of this system to be connected so it's an easy way for me and the chatgpt to undersntand the file.
