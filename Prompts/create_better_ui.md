🎨 Design Language

Minimal, White/Neutral Backgrounds → Apple relies on whitespace and soft shadows rather than heavy borders.

SF Pro Font → Apple’s system font (San Francisco Pro) is freely available and sets the tone.

Rounded Corners + Depth → Use large border-radius (12–20px), subtle shadows, and card-based layouts.

Consistent Iconography → Use a clean set (Lucide, Feather, or Apple’s SF Symbols if licensing allows).

🖼️ Frontend Frameworks

TailwindCSS: Utility-first, perfect for Apple-style minimalism.

shadcn/ui (built on Tailwind + Radix UI): Prebuilt polished components like modals, dropdowns, sliders, with clean animations.

Framer Motion: Subtle animations (fade, slide, scale) for interactions to feel fluid.

Radix UI: For accessibility + smooth primitives (menus, popovers).

⚡ Microinteractions

Hover States: Light background lift or shadow instead of color changes.

Loading Spinners → Skeleton Screens: Apple prefers skeleton placeholders (smooth grey shimmer) instead of busy spinners.

Modal Sheets: Slide-up modals like iOS sheets instead of fullscreen popups.

Progress Indicators: Smooth linear progress bars instead of abrupt percentage jumps.

📊 Dashboard/Transactions UI (specific to your app)

Summary Cards: Minimal, high contrast, soft gradients (grey/white → very subtle blue).

Charts: Use Recharts or Chart.js with simple lines/bars, muted colors, and no clutter.

Transaction List: Two-line format (merchant bold, amount right-aligned), very Venmo/Apple Wallet-like.

Roommate Balances: Display as stacked horizontal bars with subtle color (pastel blue, green, pink).

🍏 Inspiration

Look at Apple Wallet (transaction history, card style).

Look at Apple Music for smooth scrolling sections.

Look at Apple.com product pages for typography, spacing, and animations.

👉 If you’d like, I can mock up a styled base.html + dashboard.html template with Tailwind and shadcn/ui that makes your app feel Apple-polished. Do you want me to create a starting point code snippet for that?
