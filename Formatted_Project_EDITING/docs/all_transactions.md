Changes to now make to the all transactions screen

- I want there to be better totals view
- I want the default to be this month (records the last month, ex: All of September)
- I also want last week, last 3 months.

I want this to be broken down even further

- I want total spent
- then a little area for each roommates dues, how much thew owe for the period.

- theres also a custom date view that the user can change

I also want to make the subtracking to be easier, and to add in an edit mode. then when you go into edit mode, you can ckeck the minus button, and its then selected. Once you want to subtract all the transactions together, you can hit save, and then those edits will be amade and removed.

New changes
- Make these on the same line
- also make the save button work, right now theres a line thats filter is off and its bigger so fix that too.
- fix the main spot and name it [default name] Spending overview, ex: Rory's Spending Overview
    - this should be total spent, income, oweings, net amount (income - Spent + oweings), transactions
- I want the roommate spending to be 4 items:
    - roommate, spent, Owes/Owed
    - spent is the amount they paid for things, owed is the amount they still owe others
    - owes/owed is amount either positive that they must send or waiting to receive from people

- Sub Account Fixed
currently its pulling in the sub account, I want it to be all roommates that is are not the default user. In my example, IT SHOULD be only Rayna. if there are no values, just put 0 for each category and apply when needed. 

- edit mode
Right now in edit mode after I hit delete entries, it removes them, and when I hit save changes it doesn't leave edit mode. This is because save changes doesnt really do anything. I want to change this for save changes to just go out of edit mode.

new ones
- adding transaactions issues
I want to make sure the transactions uplaod is working all the time. Currently, sometimes it uplaods, sometimes it deosnt. I want the add transactions to go through nicely, and to not delete the entires sheet progress if the upload doesn't work. I also dont want to always have to select the person who paid, and what account first, I sometimes input the transactions then forget, then I clicked those 2 options, and then it made me redo it all. Just make sure the add transactions works is the main thing
