# Issues & Additions for Trial 2

- Add a - sign button on left side for removing a transaction you don’t like (make this column very small in width)
- Display smaller-width for amounts column for better readability
- Improve AI handling of expense vs. income classification. If it is green and positive it is usually an income account. If it is red or a negative it is an expense. This goes for a screenshot on bank statements (make sure the ai knows that)
- “Who Will Use” → allow simple roommate selection, have the roommates show up and you just click the button andit will be highlighted in different shade. Make it all on the same line.
- Order transactions by **confidence level** (lowest → highest). this accounts for if the ai is unsure, the user can look at that first
- Add a loading screen visual for uploading transactions, i want a circle spinning in the screen to show its being uploaded
- Allow viewing of **extracted text log** from uploaded receipts
